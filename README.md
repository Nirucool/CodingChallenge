# CodingChallenge
Illumio Coding Challenge
## Unit Test Cases-
I have used JUnit4 to test my code. 
I have considered positive, negative and edge test cases.
## What extra I could have done?
I would have implemented some design patterns.
## Implementaton details--
Pdf mentions the method name as accept_packet. I renamed it to acceptPacket as per Java Coding standards-use of Camel Case.
I have used Set to add all rules. Runtime is O(1) if two network rules are same-overridden equals method.
I would have implemented design patterns, written more test cases if I had extra time.

## Which Team I would like to join?
I would like to join-
